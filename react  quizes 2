Question 5
1 / 1 pts
A React function component must start with a capital letter.
  True 
Correct! React differentiates between a component and a regular DOM element based on capitalization. For example, making an `` component with a lowercase name wouldn't work:

function article() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>React</h1>
      <p>Component</p>
    </div>
  );
}

ReactDOM.render(<article />, document.getElementById("root"));
Trying to render this component would result in React rendering an`` HTML elementLinks to an external site.instead of the `` component.

Using an uppercase name for the function fixes this problem:

function Article() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>React</h1>
      <p>Component</p>
    </div>
  );
}

ReactDOM.render(<Article />, document.getElementById("root"));
  False

Question 6
1 / 1 pts
Given the following code, what would appear in the console?

function Parent() {
  const header = "Hello";
  const contents = "World";

  return <Child title={header} body={contents} minutesToRead={10} />;
}

function Child(props) {
  console.log(props);
  // ... return JSX
}
  
{
  title: "header",
  body: "contents",
  minutesToRead: 10
}
  
{
  title: "Hello",
  body: "World",
  minutesToRead: 10
}
Correct! The props parameter in every component is an object of key/value pairs based on the attributes assigned by the parent component.
  
{
  header: "Hello",
  contents: "World",
  minutesToRead: 10
}
  I don't know.
